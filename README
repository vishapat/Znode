ZNode - Source Code Visualizer

- To use the file reading functionality, change directory to src/ and run 
 "python -m SimpleHTTPServer". This is because Google Chrome doesn't allow local files to be read because of security issues. (Firefox does but currently our stylesheets don't work in Firefox).

- To use the Paste code, just paste javascript code into the text box. Use the files in test_files/, files for currently testing the parser and intellisense information.
